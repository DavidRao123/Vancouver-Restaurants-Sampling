```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r cars}
# Data cleaning and data preparation
full_data <- read.csv("cleaned_full_data.csv", header = T)
data <- full_data[,c("X", "restaurant", "star", "num_reviews", "city")] %>%
  rename(id = X)%>% 
  drop_na()

dim(data)
summary(data)
```



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Population mean of star
p_mean_star <- mean(data$star)
p_mean_star
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
